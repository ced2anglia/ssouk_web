How to compile the less into *.css
------- 

Everything is done in the less file (http://lesscss.org/)
Don't edit the css, 'cause they are rewritten.

On the ssouk root just write

	make watch

and then go to edit any of the less file.
We have our custom ad-hoc properties in the `ssouk.less`

Our color schema has to go in the `variables.less`

Check the docs for bootstrap http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

To compile it you need to have the `lessc` compiler installed, or use the JS.
I installed node and compile it like that.

Have fun and make it pretty.
